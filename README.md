# Winsor-Meats-Online-Shop
An online shop that I developed for Winsor Meats Limited in 2010 as part of my undergraduate final year dissertation.

Developed in PHP and MySQL used for the database.

Used MIT's AITI SMS Lib to emulate a phone that sends messages in SMS format for MPESA payment checkout to the online shop platform. This was way before Safaricom released an MPESA API. Link to the lib is here: https://github.com/lbirir/MPESA-sms-lib
